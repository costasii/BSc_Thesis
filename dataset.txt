Dataset used has been acquisited and prepared by Cook et al., when used in their work Using NLP to Predict the Severity of Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities, 2021.
Most of the data is publicly available, and maintained by MITRE organization and the National Institute of Standards of Technology.
From the cited research, we find out that at the beginning of 2021, only 50% CVE records had CVSS score assigned.
The datasets were created by human experts, and therefore didn't need much preparation nor preproccessing.
